## ISAE-SUPAERO MAE research  project

The present research project aims at discovering a reduced order model of an airfoil moving with a combination of pitch and plunge motion using the algorithm SINDy developed by professor S. Brunton and collegues.\
In particular the work will be articulated in different steps:
1. Produce a code that calculates Theodorsen solution.
2. Applying SINDy to data calculated using this script a simple model shall be retrieved.
3. Applying SINDy to data retrieved from Euler simulations a new model should be retrieved. This should be similar to the one computed in the previous point.
4. Applying SINDy to data from DNS symulations, a more general model shall be computed.\
